# AgriGuide-Project
<h3> A Full-fledged Android app for Farmers</h3>
• Developed an Android app utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting plant leaf diseases through
image processing.<br>
• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to develop machine learning models for recommending fertilizers and
crops based on weather conditions, creating a practical tool for farmers.<br>
• This app enhances agricultural decision-making by offering real-time disease diagnostics and tailored
recommendations, thereby optimizing crop management and increasing productivity.<br>
• Technologies : Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras, TFLite, Seaborn, Matplotlib
